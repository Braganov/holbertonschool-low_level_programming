# C - Recursion

## Description
This project introduces the concept of recursion in C, demonstrating how functions can call themselves to solve problems.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-puts_recursion.c | Function that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion |
| 1-print_rev_recursion.c | Function that prints a string in reverse using recursion |
| 2-strlen_recursion.c | Function that returns the length of a string using recursion |
| 3-factorial.c | Function that returns the factorial of a given number |
| 4-pow_recursion.c | Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y |
| 5-sqrt_recursion.c | Function that returns the natural square root of a number |
| 6-is_prime_number.c | Function that checks if a number is a prime number |
