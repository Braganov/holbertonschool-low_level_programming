# C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

## Description
This project builds upon the concepts of functions and nested loops, introducing more complex tasks and operations in C.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-isupper.c | Function that checks for uppercase character |
| 1-isdigit.c | Function that checks for a digit (0 through 9) |
| 2-mul.c | Function that multiplies two integers |
| 3-print_numbers.c | Function that prints numbers from 0 to 9 |
| 4-print_most_numbers.c | Function that prints numbers from 0 to 9 except 2 and 4 |
| 5-more_numbers.c | Function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14 |
| 6-print_line.c | Function that draws a straight line in the terminal |
| 7-print_diagonal.c | Function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal |
| 8-print_square.c | Function that prints a square |
| 9-fizz_buzz.c | Program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with FizzBuzz logic |
| 10-print_triangle.c | Function that prints a triangle |
