# C - malloc, free

## Description
This project explores dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free` functions. It demonstrates how to allocate, use, and free memory dynamically.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-create_array.c | Function that creates an array of chars and initializes it with a specific char |
| 1-strdup.c | Function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory containing a copy of a string |
| 2-str_concat.c | Function that concatenates two strings |
| 3-alloc_grid.c | Function that returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers |
| 4-free_grid.c | Function that frees a 2D grid previously created |

## Concepts Covered
- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`
- Releasing memory using `free`
- Handling memory leaks
- Allocating and managing 2D arrays dynamically
