# C - Function Pointers

## Description
This project explores function pointers in C, demonstrating how to use functions as arguments, how to store functions as variables, and how to implement simple callback mechanisms.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-print_name.c | Function that prints a name using a function pointer |
| 1-array_iterator.c | Function that executes a function on each element of an array |
| 2-int_index.c | Function that searches for an integer using a comparison function |
| 3-calc.h | Header file for a calculator program with function prototypes |
| 3-get_op_func.c | Function that selects the correct operation function |
| 3-main.c | Main function of the calculator program |
| 3-op_functions.c | Functions that perform arithmetic operations |

## Concepts Covered
- What are function pointers and how to use them
- Function pointer syntax and declaration
- Where to store function pointers
- Using function pointers as callbacks
