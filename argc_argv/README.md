## Description
This project explores command-line arguments in C programs using `argc` and `argv` parameters to the main function.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-whatsmyname.c | Program that prints its own name |
| 1-args.c | Program that prints the number of arguments passed to it |
| 2-args.c | Program that prints all arguments it receives |
| 3-mul.c | Program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments |
| 4-add.c | Program that adds positive numbers passed as arguments |
