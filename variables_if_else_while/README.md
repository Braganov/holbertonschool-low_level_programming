# C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
This project introduces the use of variables, conditional statements (`if`, `else`), and loops (`while`) in C programming.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-positive_or_negative.c | Program that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero |
| 1-last_digit.c | Program that prints the last digit of a random number |
| 2-print_alphabet.c | Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase |
| 3-print_alphabets.c | Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase |
| 4-print_alphabt.c | Program that prints the alphabet except 'q' and 'e' |
| 5-print_numbers.c | Program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 |
| 6-print_numberz.c | Program that prints all single-digit numbers without using char |
| 7-print_tebahpla.c | Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse |
| 8-print_base16.c | Program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase |
| 9-print_comb.c | Program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers |

## Concepts Covered
- Declaring and using variables
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Printing output using `printf` and `putchar`
