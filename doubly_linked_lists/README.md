# C - Doubly Linked Lists

## Description
This project explores doubly linked lists in C, providing implementations of various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-print_dlistint.c | Function that prints all elements of a doubly linked list |
| 1-dlistint_len.c | Function that returns the number of elements in a list |
| 2-add_dnodeint.c | Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list |
| 3-add_dnodeint_end.c | Function that adds a new node at the end of a list |
| 4-free_dlistint.c | Function that frees a doubly linked list |
| 5-get_dnodeint.c | Function that returns the nth node of a list |
| 6-sum_dlistint.c | Function that returns the sum of all data in a list |
| 7-insert_dnodeint.c | Function that inserts a new node at a given position |
| 8-delete_dnodeint.c | Function that deletes a node at a given position |

## Concepts Covered
