# C - Functions, Nested Loops

## Description
This project focuses on C functions and nested loops, introducing fundamental concepts of function declaration, definition, and usage of loops for repetitive tasks.

| 2-print_alphabet_x10.c | Function that prints the alphabet 10 times |
| 3-islower.c | Function that checks for lowercase character |
| 4-isalpha.c | Function that checks for alphabetic character |
| 5-sign.c | Function that prints the sign of a number |
| 6-abs.c | Function that computes the absolute value of an integer |
| 7-print_last_digit.c | Function that prints the last digit of a number |
| 8-24_hours.c | Function that prints every minute of the day |
| 9-times_table.c | Function that prints the 9 times table |
| 10-add.c | Function that adds two integers and returns the result |
| 11-print_to_98.c | Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98 |
