# C - Structures, typedef

## Description
This project introduces structures and the `typedef` keyword in C, demonstrating how to define and use custom data types.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| dog.h | Header file defining a new type `struct dog` and `typedef` for `dog_t` |
| 1-init_dog.c | Function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog` |
| 2-print_dog.c | Function that prints a `struct dog` |
| 4-new_dog.c | Function that creates a new dog |
| 5-free_dog.c | Function that frees memory allocated for a `struct dog` |

## Concepts Covered
- Defining and using structures
- Using `typedef` to create type aliases
- Memory management with structures
- Passing structures to functions
