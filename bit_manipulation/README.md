# C - Bit Manipulation

## Description
This project focuses on manipulating bits and using bitwise operators in C.

## Files and Their Functionality

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-binary_to_uint.c | Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int |
| 1-print_binary.c | Function that prints the binary representation of a number |
| 2-get_bit.c | Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index |
| 3-set_bit.c | Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index |
| 4-clear_bit.c | Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index |
| 5-flip_bits.c | Function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another |

## Concepts Covered
- Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
- Binary representation of numbers
- Bit manipulation techniques
